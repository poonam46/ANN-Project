# Car Price Prediction project
This project predicts the selling price of used cars based on their features like car name, year, fuel type, seller type, kilometers driven, etc.
Predict the selling price of used cars based on car features using a feedforward neural network built with PyTorch.
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, neural network modeling, and evaluation for regression tasks.
# Technologies Used:
1) Python
2) PyTorch (Neural Network)
3) Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation)
4) Scikit-learn (Preprocessing, train-test split, metrics)
